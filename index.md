## Introduction

### Experiment Aims

* To show that privacy notices don't need to be hand crafted.
* To show that well-structured and controlled metadata can be used to auto-build a high quality privacy notice.
* To inspire further thinking on this topic.

### Approach
* This page has been built quickly using a simple GitHub pages/Jekyl implementation.
* The following section of this page presents a Privacy Notice that is auto-generated from a CSV file of metadata which can be viewed [Here](#).
* The privacy notice (and metadata used to build this page) is entirely fictional
