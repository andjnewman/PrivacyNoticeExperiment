# PrivacyNoticeExperiment

## Introduction

### Experiment Aims

* To show that privacy notices don't need to be hand crafted.
* To show that well-structured and controlled metadata can be used to automatically build a high quality privacy notice.
* To inspire further thinking on this topic.

### Approach
* This page has been built quickly using a simple GitHub pages/Jekyl implementation (apologies for the ugly templating)
* The [Privacy Notice page](PrivacyNotice12345) presents a Privacy Notice for a dataset that is auto-generated from a CSV file of metadata which can be viewed [Here](https://github.com/andjnewman/PrivacyNoticeExperiment/blob/master/_data/goatlicences.csv).
* Whilst this experiment portrays a dataset it may be more appropriate to structure privacy notices (and thus metadata) around services the user understands.
* all content on the privacy notice and csv is entirely fictional (it is not an example of a good privacy notice!).
* Text shown in **_italics_** on the privacy notice is automatically generated based on the CSV data.
